priorities
==========

This is a Vue application for prioritizing a list of options by
choosing one of each pair of options. It currently requires local
copies of [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Pico
CSS](https://picocss.com/), but could equally well use CDNs.

Design questions
----------------

Currently, the scored and ordered list does not appear until the user
makes all the choices. Is this correct?
