priorities
==========

This is a Vue application for prioritizing a list of options by choosing one of each pair of options. It currently requires local copies of [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/), but could equally well use CDNs.

Design questions
----------------

Currently, the ordered list does not appear until the user makes all the choices. Is this correct?

Currently, adding a new item to a prioritization, completed or not, removes all the choices made so far. Is this correct? I think no.
